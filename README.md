# The long-term strategic plan is to replace the existing socket-based system with an Inter-Process Communications (IPC) system using Windows Communications Forms technologies. Senior managers at Marlin would like to create a custom third-party library for the new application which can be licenced for use by other organisations. The business plan is to grow the number of locations to include Eastern Europe, Asia and Canada. Therefore, the Astronomical Processing application will be expanded to include additional languages and UI customizations. The new client-server application will utilise the Inter-Process Communications technologies and require a network upgrade to the communications infrastructure to support the application.
